          I am a highly motivated data analyst transitioning to a software
          engineering role with a Masterâ€™s degree in Information Systems (in
          progress). With three years of experience as a business analyst and
          data analyst at a tech startup, I bring to the table strong analytical
          expertise while finding innovative software solutions for
          problem-solving. I am excited to continue building on my existing
          skillset while learning new technologies and approaches to software
          development. I am committed to staying at the forefront of
          cutting-edge technologies and applying my knowledge to develop
          creative and efficient software solutions.
